Speech on Donald Trump’s Recent Actions and My Opinion

Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, we are tasked with discussing one of the most controversial figures in modern American politics—Donald J. Trump. From his time as a businessman and reality TV star to his presidency and the aftermath of his term, Trump’s actions have left a lasting impact on the political landscape. But even after his term ended, his influence and actions have continued to stir both fervent support and intense criticism. As we examine Donald Trump's recent actions, it’s crucial to keep in mind the complex nature of his influence, the divided opinions about him, and the consequences of those actions on American society and the broader global stage.

The 2016 Election and His Presidency

Donald Trump's rise to power began with his unexpected victory in the 2016 presidential election. He capitalized on widespread frustration with the political establishment, particularly among those who felt left behind by globalization, economic shifts, and cultural changes. His promise to “Make America Great Again” resonated with millions of Americans who felt that their voices were not being heard. His rhetoric was unapologetically bold, often divisive, and at times inflammatory. Whether it was his stance on immigration, trade, or foreign policy, Trump’s presidency was marked by a radical departure from traditional political norms.

During his tenure, Trump enacted significant tax cuts, focused on deregulation, and prioritized economic growth. His administration saw a period of strong economic performance prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with record-low unemployment and stock market highs. However, these actions were not without controversy. His tax cuts, for example, were criticized for disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest Americans and corporations, raising concerns about widening income inequality. Furthermore, his “America First” foreign policy, while popular among his base, alienated long-standing international alliances and led to a more isolationist U.S. presence on the world stage.

The Aftermath of the 2020 Election

Perhaps no action has been as divisive as Trump's response to the 2020 presidential election. After losing to Joe Biden, Trump’s refusal to accept the outcome set off a series of events that culminated in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This act of violence was the direct result of Trump’s repeated claims of election fraud, despite a lack of evidence and numerous court rulings dismissing those claims. The insurrection that followed was one of the darkest days in American history, as rioters breached the Capitol, threatening the lives of lawmakers and law enforcement officers.

Trump’s role in inciting the insurrection has been the subject of intense scrutiny. He was impeached for a second time, making him the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. While the Senate acquitted him, the events of January 6 have left a permanent stain on his legacy. To many, Trump's actions demonstrated an unwillingness to uphold democratic norms and respect the will of the voters, creating a deepening rift in American society.

Post-Presidency and Continued Influence

Despite leaving office in January 2021, Trump’s influence has not waned. He has continued to shape the Republican Party, maintaining a strong grip on its base. He remains an incredibly polarizing figure—his supporters praise him for challenging the establishment and promoting a more nationalistic agenda, while his detractors see him as a threat to democracy and an embodiment of unchecked populism.

In the months following his presidency, Trump continued to push false narratives about the 2020 election, even as these claims were debunked by various election officials and independent sources. He has also continued to rally his supporters with claims that he could run again in 2024, keeping his political influence alive and drawing national attention to his every move.

Trump’s post-presidency actions—such as endorsing candidates for the 2022 midterms and continuing to hold large rallies—demonstrate that he still wields significant power within the GOP. This, however, has sparked division within the party itself. While some Republicans embrace Trump’s populist platform, others, particularly those in more moderate positions, are concerned that his continued dominance of the party will push it further toward extremism, potentially alienating independent voters and centrist Republicans.

Public Perception and Media

One of the most consistent aspects of Donald Trump’s tenure, both in office and beyond, is his relationship with the media. Trump has a unique ability to dominate the news cycle, often through controversial statements or actions. His disdain for mainstream media outlets, which he labeled “fake news,” fueled his supporters’ distrust of the press. He used social media—particularly Twitter—as a direct communication tool, bypassing traditional outlets and speaking directly to his audience. This strategy helped him maintain his political base but also contributed to the growing polarization in American media.

Trump’s use of social media was unprecedented. His tweets and posts were often a direct reflection of his thoughts in real time, with little filter or consideration for the potential consequences. While this style of communication energized his supporters, it also led to misinformation, inflammatory rhetoric, and frequent contradictions. His Twitter account was ultimately banned for violating policies on incitement of violence, signaling a shift in how social platforms regulate content and the spread of falsehoods.

Conclusion: My Opinion of Donald Trump

As I reflect on Donald Trump’s actions, it’s clear that he is a figure who defies easy categorization. To some, he remains a champion of the working class, an outsider who dared to challenge the entrenched political elites and advocate for the interests of ordinary Americans. His commitment to a nationalist agenda and his focus on issues like immigration, trade, and economic growth resonated deeply with millions of people who felt sidelined by the globalized order.

However, his actions—especially post-presidency—have left me with serious concerns about the future of American democracy. His repeated attempts to undermine the 2020 election, the January 6th insurrection, and his divisive rhetoric are troubling signs that he prioritizes his own interests over the integrity of democratic institutions. His unwillingness to accept defeat in a fair election process, coupled with his encouragement of violent actions by his supporters, undermines the very principles that the United States was founded upon.

In my opinion, Donald Trump is a deeply polarizing figure who has reshaped American politics in ways that will have lasting consequences. Whether for better or worse, he has left an indelible mark on the political landscape, and his actions will be debated for years to come.

Thank you.
