Speech: The Dangerous Legacy of Donald Trump’s Recent Actions
Introduction
Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,

We are here today because democracy is under threat. We are here because the recent actions of Donald Trump—his lies, his corruption, and his blatant disregard for the rule of law—demand our outrage. Whether it’s his attempts to overturn elections, his incitement of political violence, or his alarming promises of authoritarian rule if re-elected, Trump represents a clear and present danger to this country.

This isn’t about partisan politics. This is about the survival of American democracy. So today, we must speak truth to power: Donald Trump is unfit to lead, and his recent actions prove it.

1. Trump’s Role in Undermining Democracy
Let’s start with the most glaring threat—Trump’s relentless assault on free and fair elections.

The Big Lie & Election Denial: Even after 60+ court losses, Trump continues to push the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. This wasn’t just a false claim—it was an attack on democracy itself, designed to erode public trust and justify future power grabs.

Encouraging Violence: His rhetoric led directly to the January 6th insurrection, where a violent mob stormed the Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Five people died. Hundreds were injured. And yet, Trump praised the rioters and still calls them “patriots.”

Supporting Election Sabotage: Now, Trump and his allies are purging election officials, pushing voter suppression laws, and even floating the idea of ignoring election results in 2024 if he loses. This is the playbook of a wannabe dictator, not a president.

If we allow this to continue, we are normalizing coups. We are accepting that losers can overturn elections by force. That is not America.

2. Trump’s Corruption & Lawlessness
Trump doesn’t just break norms—he breaks the law, and he does it shamelessly.

The Classified Documents Scandal: Trump stole top-secret files from the White House, stored them in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom and ballroom, and lied to the FBI about returning them. These weren’t just souvenirs—they contained nuclear secrets and military vulnerabilities. If anyone else did this, they’d be in prison for decades.

Fraud & Financial Crimes: He’s been found liable for fraud in New York, inflating his wealth to cheat banks and taxpayers. His charity was shut down for stealing from veterans and children. His business was convicted of tax fraud. This is a man who sees government as a personal ATM.

Obstruction of Justice: From firing the FBI director to pressuring witnesses, Trump has repeatedly tried to bury investigations into his crimes. A president should not be above the law—yet he acts like he is.

A man this corrupt should never hold power again.

3. Trump’s Authoritarian Vision for America
Now, Trump isn’t even hiding his plans for a second term. He’s openly promising dictatorship.

"Retribution" Against Opponents: He vows to prosecute Biden and other political rivals, turning the Justice Department into his personal revenge machine. This is what tin-pot dictators do—not leaders of a democracy.

Mass Deportation Camps: He’s planning military roundups of millions of immigrants, echoing the darkest chapters of history.

Purging the Government: He wants to fire tens of thousands of civil servants and replace them with loyalists, destroying checks and balances.

Abandoning NATO & Empowering Putin: He’s repeatedly praised dictators (Putin, Kim Jong Un, Orbán) while threatening to abandon democratic allies.

This isn’t conservatism—it’s fascism. And if we don’t stop it now, we may not get another chance.

4. The Threat of Political Violence
Trump doesn’t just inspire violence—he excuses it.

January 6th was just the beginning. His supporters have threatened judges, attacked the FBI, and plotted kidnappings of governors.

He calls convicted rioters "hostages" and promises to pardon them, sending a clear message: Violence is rewarded if it’s for Trump.

His rhetoric is getting worse: “Bloodbath if I lose,” “terminate the Constitution,” “vermin” opponents. These are the words of a demagogue, not a leader.

If Trump returns to power, political violence will escalate. More people will die. And democracy may not recover.

Conclusion: Our Duty to Fight Back
So what do we do?

Vote like democracy depends on it—because it does.

Protest, organize, and never normalize Trump’s crimes.

Hold every politician accountable who enables him.

Defend the truth against his lies.

This isn’t just about Trump—it’s about what kind of country we want to be. Do we accept corruption, violence, and tyranny? Or do we stand up and say NO MORE?

Today, we choose resistance. Today, we say: Trump will not destroy our democracy.

Thank you.
