Speech: Standing Against the Damage and Danger of Donald Trump’s Recent Actions

Delivered on April 6, 2025, at a Protest Against the Trump Administration

Good afternoon, everyone! Thank you for being here today, united in this fight for justice, freedom, and the future of our nation. We stand together because we see what’s happening—because we refuse to stay silent while Donald Trump’s recent actions tear at the fabric of our democracy, our economy, and our humanity. His second term has barely begun, and already we’re witnessing a cascade of reckless decisions that threaten everything we hold dear. Today, I want to talk about why his actions are not just damaging but dangerous—and why we must resist with every fiber of our being.

Let’s start with the economy. Trump swept back into power promising prosperity, but what has he delivered? A tariff war that’s shaking the foundations of global trade. In the past few months, he’s slapped sweeping tariffs—25% on goods from Canada and Mexico alone—claiming it’s “our turn” to strike back. But who’s paying the price? We are. Families are seeing grocery bills climb, small businesses are scrambling to survive, and markets are reeling from what some are calling the worst crisis since the pandemic. Workers in places like Texas and California, who rely on cross-border trade, are losing jobs while corporations hoard profits. This isn’t economic strength—it’s economic sabotage, driven by a man who cares more about headlines than people’s livelihoods.

And it’s not just at home. Trump’s obsession with flexing power on the world stage is isolating us. He’s ridiculed allies, threatened to pull out of agreements like the Paris Climate Accord—again—and even mused about seizing Greenland, as if nations are pieces on a Monopoly board. Our global image is crumbling, and with it, our ability to lead or even cooperate. When Canada’s fans boo our anthem at hockey games, when protests erupt from London to Mexico City, it’s a sign: Trump’s actions aren’t making America great—they’re making us a pariah.

Then there’s the border—his so-called “sweeping crackdown.” Trump promised safety, but what he’s unleashed is chaos and cruelty. He’s empowered agencies like ICE to hunt down not just undocumented immigrants but legal residents—students, workers, dreamers—based on vague accusations of “disloyalty” or social media posts. In March, we saw a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia arrested for protesting, his visa revoked not for crimes but for his views. This isn’t security; it’s a purge. Families are being torn apart, communities terrorized, all while Trump brags about deportations like they’re trophies. And his talk of using the military—our National Guard, even active-duty troops—against civilians on American soil? That’s not a promise of protection. That’s a threat of tyranny.

But perhaps the most chilling danger lies in what Trump’s doing to our voices—our right to speak, to dissent, to be heard. He campaigned as a “champion of free speech,” yet his actions tell a different story. Look at the crackdown on protests: he’s labeled them “illegal” if he doesn’t like the message, threatening colleges with funding cuts and activists with jail. In February, the 50501 protests—50 states, one day of resistance—saw thousands rally against his policies, only to face warnings of imprisonment or deportation for “agitators.” Students at universities like Columbia and Stanford are being silenced, their funding slashed if they dare criticize him. And it’s not just students—law firms representing his critics have been sanctioned, media outlets pressured, even members of Congress censured for speaking out, like Representative Al Green, ejected from the chamber during Trump’s address last month.

This isn’t about law and order. It’s about control. Trump’s administration, with allies like Elon Musk at the helm of his “Department of Government Efficiency,” is gutting oversight, firing civil servants, and replacing them with loyalists. They’re dismantling agencies like USAID, slashing aid for disaster relief and global health, all while Musk—a billionaire with no mandate—rifles through taxpayer data. When a president cheers the arrest of a protester, when he threatens judges who rule against him, when he uses executive orders to rewrite citizenship laws or election rules, we’re not just losing freedoms—we’re losing democracy itself.

And let’s talk about Project 2025, the playbook Trump claims he doesn’t follow but mirrors step by step. This isn’t a conspiracy—it’s a blueprint for authoritarianism, crafted by his own team. It calls for crushing dissent, banning abortion nationwide, and turning our government into a machine for his whims. He’s already pulled us out of climate agreements, rolled back protections for trans kids, and pushed policies that favor the rich while gutting Medicaid and Social Security. Every day, we see another piece of this agenda snap into place, and every day, it gets harder to push back.

So why is this dangerous? Because it’s not just policy—it’s power unchecked. Trump’s surrounded himself with enablers—people like Russ Vought, who say he can “absolutely be trusted” with the Justice Department, or Marco Rubio, who shrugs off free speech concerns as “not an issue.” With a Supreme Court ruling giving him near-total immunity, with a Congress too timid or too complicit to act, the guardrails are gone. He’s not just breaking norms; he’s breaking the system. And when that happens, it’s not the powerful who suffer—it’s us. It’s the worker losing healthcare, the student losing her future, the immigrant losing his home.

But here’s the thing: we’re not powerless. We’re here today because we see the damage, we feel the danger, and we refuse to let it stand. History shows us that when people rise—when we march, when we shout, when we vote—tyranny falters. Trump wants us quiet, divided, afraid. But look around: we’re none of those things. We’re loud, we’re together, and we’re fearless. Every sign you hold, every chant you raise, every step you take today sends a message: we will not bow to this man or his chaos.

So let’s keep fighting. Call out the tariffs that choke us, the crackdowns that cage us, the silencing that suffocates us. Demand accountability—not just from Trump, but from every leader who lets this happen. Organize, resist, persist. Because this isn’t just about one man’s actions—it’s about the soul of our nation. And that soul is worth saving.

Thank you, and let’s keep the fire burning!
