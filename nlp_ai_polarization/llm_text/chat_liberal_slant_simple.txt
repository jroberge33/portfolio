The Damaging and Dangerous Actions of Donald Trump

Introduction:

Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Thank you for being here today. We gather here to express our concern and outrage over the recent actions of Donald Trump, which have had a profound and dangerous impact on our nation and the world. As citizens committed to justice, democracy, and the well-being of our communities, we must stand against the rhetoric and behavior that threaten to undermine the values we hold dear.

Today, I will address the specific ways in which Trump's actions have been damaging, dangerous, and, ultimately, a threat to the principles of fairness, accountability, and unity that our country needs.

1. Undermining Democracy:

One of the most dangerous aspects of Trump’s recent actions has been his repeated attacks on the democratic process. We saw this most clearly in his efforts to undermine the results of the 2020 election. After losing, he pushed baseless claims of voter fraud and encouraged his supporters to reject the outcome of the election. He went so far as to pressure officials to overturn the election results, even suggesting the use of the military to intervene.

This is not just a political disagreement—it is a direct assault on the integrity of our democracy. The peaceful transfer of power, the cornerstone of a functioning democracy, was put at risk by his actions. By spreading lies and encouraging civil unrest, he sowed division and mistrust in our election system, which is the foundation of our nation’s identity.

2. Inciting Violence:

Trump’s rhetoric has long been inflammatory and divisive, but in recent months, it has become even more alarming. His words have incited violence, as we saw on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the certification of the election results. Trump’s rhetoric leading up to the insurrection was reckless and dangerous. He repeatedly told his followers that the election had been “stolen,” stoking anger and frustration.

On that fateful day, the consequences of his words were felt in the form of death, injury, and damage to our Capitol. The January 6th attack was not an isolated incident but a symptom of the larger culture of violence and division that Trump has fostered. By refusing to denounce white supremacy, emboldening extremist groups, and fueling hatred, Trump has allowed violent ideologies to gain ground in American politics.

3. Eroding Trust in Institutions:

Trump’s behavior has also had a corrosive effect on public trust in key institutions of our government, including the judiciary, the media, and law enforcement. He has made a habit of labeling the press as "fake news," disregarding their role as independent watchdogs of democracy. His attacks on journalists have made it harder for people to distinguish fact from fiction, leading to the spread of misinformation and confusion among the public.

Moreover, Trump’s interference in the Department of Justice, including his dismissal of officials who wouldn’t comply with his demands, has undermined the independence of law enforcement agencies. His politicization of the justice system has resulted in a lack of accountability for those in power, fostering an environment where corruption and abuse of power go unchecked.

4. Dismantling Civil Rights Protections:

Under Trump’s leadership, we saw a troubling erosion of civil rights protections for marginalized communities. He has consistently attacked policies that protect the rights of women, people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ individuals. From his "zero tolerance" immigration policies that separated children from their families at the border to his rollback of protections for transgender people in healthcare and education, Trump has systematically sought to undermine the rights and dignity of vulnerable groups.

His administration also weakened environmental regulations, rolled back healthcare protections, and implemented tax policies that favored the wealthy over the working class. All of these actions were part of a broader agenda that prioritized corporate interests over the well-being of ordinary Americans, especially those already facing systemic disadvantages.

5. Climate Change Denial and Environmental Damage:

Trump’s stance on climate change has been another damaging aspect of his time in office. By pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, he rejected the scientific consensus on the urgent need to address climate change. His administration rolled back key environmental protections, allowing corporations to pollute more freely and putting the health of our planet and future generations at risk.

We are already witnessing the devastating effects of climate change—rising temperatures, stronger storms, and more frequent wildfires—and Trump’s refusal to acknowledge the science behind these changes is an unacceptable failure of leadership. Instead of prioritizing sustainability and environmental protection, his policies have empowered industries that profit from environmental destruction.

6. Economic Inequality and Mismanagement of the COVID-19 Crisis:

Trump's economic policies disproportionately benefited the wealthy, further deepening the divide between the rich and the poor. His administration’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations did little to address the needs of working families. Meanwhile, millions of Americans struggled to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trump’s response to the pandemic was chaotic and ineffective. His downplaying of the virus and refusal to follow public health advice led to unnecessary deaths and economic devastation. Rather than providing leadership during this crisis, he promoted misinformation and failed to offer a coherent national strategy. The result was a crisis that could have been better managed if it weren't for his reckless decisions and lack of empathy for those suffering.

Conclusion:

Donald Trump’s recent actions have shown us the danger of a leader who prioritizes personal gain over the welfare of the people he is supposed to serve. His disregard for truth, his willingness to incite division and violence, and his undermining of democratic norms have left a lasting scar on this nation. We are here today because we cannot afford to ignore the damage he has caused and continues to cause.

As we move forward, we must remain vigilant in protecting our democracy, our institutions, and the rights of all people. The fight against the harmful legacy of Trump’s actions is not over, and we must continue to hold him accountable, demand justice, and work toward a future where equality, truth, and democracy prevail.

Thank you for being here and for standing up for what is right. Together, we can build a better future for all.
