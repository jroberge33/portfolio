# A Time for Civic Reflection

Fellow citizens and concerned Americans,

Today, we gather not merely as protesters, but as guardians of democracy—a system that depends on our vigilance and active participation. Our presence here represents a fundamental American tradition: the peaceful assembly of citizens exercising their right to voice concerns about the direction of our nation.

## The Stakes Before Us

Democracy functions on a delicate balance of institutions, norms, and shared values. When this balance is threatened, we must speak out. The actions we've witnessed from former President Trump since leaving office have repeatedly challenged this equilibrium. From continuing to deny the legitimate results of the 2020 election well into his second campaign, to the events surrounding January 6th, 2021, to rhetoric that increasingly portrays political opponents as enemies rather than fellow Americans with different views—these patterns represent a departure from the democratic traditions that have sustained our republic for nearly 250 years.

## A Nation of Laws, Not Men

America's founders established a system specifically designed to prevent the concentration of power in any single individual. They created a government of laws, not men—a critical distinction that has served as a bulwark against authoritarianism throughout our history.

When any leader, regardless of party affiliation, suggests they are above accountability or that institutions should bend to personal will rather than constitutional boundaries, we face a fundamental challenge to this founding principle. The calls to terminate parts of the Constitution, the attempts to pressure election officials, and the systematic undermining of the peaceful transfer of power—these are not merely policy disagreements but attacks on the very framework of our democratic system.

## The Erosion of Truth

Perhaps most corrosive to our democracy has been the assault on truth itself. A functional democracy depends on citizens having access to reliable information to make informed decisions. When falsehoods about election integrity are repeatedly amplified despite being rejected by courts, election officials from both parties, and multiple recounts and audits, the result is not just misinformation—it's an erosion of the common factual ground necessary for democratic debate.

The proliferation of conspiracy theories, particularly those targeting election workers and officials who were simply doing their jobs, has had real consequences: death threats against public servants, increased political violence, and a dangerous decline in trust in our electoral processes.

## The Impact on Our National Fabric

Beyond institutional damage, we've witnessed a coarsening of our civic discourse that threatens to tear the social fabric that binds us as Americans. The demonization of the press as "enemies of the people," the labeling of political opponents as "traitors," and rhetoric that divides Americans into "real" citizens versus others—these tactics may win short-term political battles but inflict long-term damage on our capacity to function as one nation.

Democracy depends not just on laws and institutions but on unwritten norms of mutual respect and recognition of our common citizenship despite our differences. When these norms collapse, democracy itself becomes vulnerable.

## Leadership and Responsibility

Leadership carries with it profound responsibility. Words matter, especially from those who hold or have held our nation's highest office. When such leaders embrace and amplify extremist rhetoric, when they flirt with or openly endorse political violence, they legitimize these dangerous impulses and move them from the fringe into the mainstream of American politics.

We've seen this pattern repeatedly—from statements that there were "very fine people on both sides" in Charlottesville, to telling the Proud Boys to "stand back and stand by," to the embrace of increasingly extreme rhetoric targeting immigrants and political opponents. These are not the actions of leadership that seeks to heal and unite a divided nation.

## Beyond Partisanship

I want to be clear: today's demonstration transcends traditional partisan divides. This is not about policy disagreements on taxation, healthcare, or even immigration. People of good faith can and do disagree on these matters. Rather, this is about fundamental questions concerning the nature of our democracy itself.

Many principled conservatives and Republicans have spoken out against these tendencies precisely because they recognize the danger they pose to the constitutional system we all cherish. Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Judge J. Michael Luttig, and many others have risked their careers to uphold their oath to the Constitution over loyalty to any individual.

## The Path Forward

So where do we go from here? How do we heal these divisions and strengthen our democratic foundations?

First, we must recommit ourselves to truth and integrity in our public discourse, demanding the same from our leaders across the political spectrum.

Second, we must strengthen the guardrails that protect our democracy—supporting reforms that ensure election integrity while expanding access to the ballot, protecting election workers from intimidation, and reinforcing the independence of our justice system.

Third, we must engage in civic education that reminds all Americans of our shared democratic heritage and the principles that unite us beyond our differences.

And finally, we must practice the difficult art of democratic citizenship—standing firm for our convictions while recognizing the humanity and patriotism of those with whom we disagree.

## A Call to Civic Courage

In closing, I remind us all that democracy is not a spectator sport. It requires our active participation, our critical thinking, and sometimes our courageous dissent. As citizens, we have not just the right but the responsibility to speak out when we believe our democratic institutions are in danger.

Today's demonstration is not an act of division but an expression of patriotic concern—concern that the American experiment in self-government, this noble idea that We the People can govern ourselves through laws and institutions rather than force and intimidation, must be protected against threats from any quarter.

Let us leave here today committed not just to resistance but to renewal—the renewal of our democratic spirit, our shared sense of national purpose, and our belief that what unites us as Americans is ultimately stronger than what divides us.

Thank you, and may God bless our democratic republic.
