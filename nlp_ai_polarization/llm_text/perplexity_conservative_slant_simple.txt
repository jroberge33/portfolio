## **Speech in Support of President Donald J. Trump**

Ladies and gentlemen, fellow patriots,

It is an honor to stand before you today as we rally together in support of a leader who has proven time and again his commitment to the American people: President Donald J. Trump. Over the past months, President Trump has taken bold and decisive actions that have not only reaffirmed his dedication to an America-first agenda but also delivered tangible benefits to our great nation. Today, I want to highlight the ways in which his leadership has been both beneficial and effective for our country.

### **Securing Our Borders and Protecting American Lives**

One of President Trump’s most significant accomplishments has been his unparalleled success in securing our borders. Illegal border crossings have plummeted to historic lows—down 94% from February of last year and 96% from the all-time high under the previous administration. In some areas, crossings have decreased by an astounding 99%[2]. This achievement ensures that our communities are safer, our resources are protected, and our laws are respected.

President Trump also signed the Laken Riley Act into law, mandating the detention of illegal immigrants arrested for theft or violence. This legislation honors the memory of a young American whose life was tragically cut short by an illegal immigrant released into the country[2]. By prioritizing law and order, President Trump has sent a clear message: the safety and security of American citizens come first.

### **Restoring Energy Independence**

Under President Trump’s leadership, America is regaining its energy independence. He has rescinded job-killing regulations imposed by the previous administration, including ending the disastrous liquefied natural gas (LNG) export ban and pausing federal permits for massive wind farms that failed to serve American consumers[2]. By withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office, President Trump put an end to policies that unfairly burdened our economy while benefiting foreign nations[1][2].

Furthermore, his declaration of a “national energy emergency” has allowed us to unlock America’s vast energy resources, reducing reliance on foreign imports and lowering energy costs for families across the country[1].

### **Economic Growth Through Deregulation**

President Trump’s deregulation efforts have saved Americans $180 billion—equivalent to $2,100 for a family of four[2]. These savings come from rolling back burdensome rules on appliances like air conditioners, gas stoves, and water heaters that would have cost American families thousands of dollars each[2]. By prioritizing affordability over unnecessary restrictions, President Trump has ensured that hardworking Americans can keep more money in their pockets.

Additionally, his administration’s focus on fiscal discipline has led to significant reductions in federal spending. Measures such as streamlining government operations and reducing workforce redundancies reflect his commitment to efficient governance[1].

---

### **Reforming Education**

Education reform remains a cornerstone of President Trump’s agenda. He has taken executive action to empower parents in choosing their children’s education while advocating for returning control of schools back to the states[2]. By eliminating funding for programs promoting divisive ideologies like “gender ideology” and “discriminatory equity ideology,” he is ensuring that schools focus on academic excellence rather than political indoctrination[1][2].

These actions align with his broader vision of fostering educational freedom and reforming outdated federal regulations that hinder progress at the state level.

### **Championing Peace Abroad**

On the international stage, President Trump has demonstrated extraordinary leadership by pursuing peace where it seemed impossible. His historic peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia have brought these nations closer to resolving their conflict[2]. Similarly, his bold vision for securing lasting peace in Gaza—proposed during discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—has been described as “brilliant” and “historic” by experts[2].

Through these efforts, President Trump is proving that diplomacy rooted in strength can achieve what many deemed unattainable.

---

### **Ending Government Overreach**

President Trump has made it a priority to end the weaponization of government against its citizens. His administration has rooted out politically motivated lawfare from previous years, suspended security clearances for individuals involved in spreading misinformation, and ended federal censorship of Americans’ voices online[2]. These actions reaffirm his commitment to protecting constitutional freedoms and ensuring that government serves the people—not special interests.

---

### **Revitalizing National Defense**

Under President Trump’s leadership, military recruitment has reached its highest levels in over a decade. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force have all reported record-breaking numbers as young Americans answer the call to serve their country[2]. This resurgence reflects renewed confidence in our armed forces under a commander-in-chief who prioritizes strength and readiness.

---

### **Trade Policies That Put America First**

President Trump’s trade policies have been designed with one goal: putting America first. His tariffs on imports from countries like China, Mexico, and Canada are projected to raise nearly $3 trillion in revenue over the next decade while reducing dependence on foreign goods[3]. Though these measures come with challenges, they represent a critical step toward leveling the playing field for American workers and industries.

By leveraging tools such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), President Trump is addressing issues like fentanyl trafficking while protecting key sectors like steel and aluminum production from unfair competition[3].

### **Conclusion: A Vision for America’s Future**

Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing a presidency defined by action, results, and unwavering dedication to the American people. From securing our borders to revitalizing our economy, reforming education, championing peace abroad, and standing up against government overreach—President Donald J. Trump is delivering on his promises.

As we gather here today in support of his leadership, let us remember that this movement is about more than one man; it is about preserving the values that make America great: freedom, opportunity, security, and justice. Together, we will continue to build on these achievements and ensure a brighter future for generations to come.

Thank you all for being here today. God bless you, God bless President Donald J. Trump, and God bless the United States of America!
