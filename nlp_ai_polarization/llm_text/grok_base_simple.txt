Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens,

Today, I stand before you to discuss the recent actions of President Donald J. Trump, who returned to the White House on January 20, 2025, for his second term. As of this moment, April 6, 2025, we are just over two months into his administration, and already, the pace and scope of his decisions have sparked intense debate across the nation and beyond. My goal is not to blindly praise or condemn, but to reflect on what he has done, what it means for us, and where I stand in my opinion of him.

Let’s begin with the facts. Since taking office, President Trump has signed over 111 executive orders, a remarkable number in such a short time. These actions touch on everything from immigration and trade to energy policy and government reform. On his first day, he deployed National Guard troops to the southern border, suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement—moves that echo promises from his campaign trail. In the weeks that followed, he imposed steep tariffs, including a 25% duty on steel and aluminum imports and a 10% tariff on all trading partners except Canada and Mexico. He’s declared a national energy emergency to fast-track fossil fuel projects, rolled back diversity initiatives in federal agencies, and issued controversial pardons, including for those convicted in the January 6 riot.

These actions paint a picture of a leader intent on reshaping America swiftly and decisively. Supporters see this as a bold fulfillment of his “America First” vision—a rejection of bureaucracy and globalism in favor of national strength and economic independence. Critics, however, argue it’s a reckless power grab, undermining democratic norms and international cooperation. So, what do we make of this flurry of activity?

Let’s start with immigration. Trump’s border security measures—like reinstating the “Remain in Mexico” policy and enhancing vetting—aim to address what he calls a crisis of illegal crossings. The deployment of the National Guard signals a militarized approach, one he claims is necessary to protect American communities. I see the logic in wanting secure borders; it’s a fundamental duty of any government. Yet, I worry about the human cost. Suspending refugee admissions indefinitely cuts off a lifeline for those fleeing unimaginable hardship. It’s a policy that feels more like a wall than a door, and I question whether it aligns with the compassion America has historically shown.

On trade, Trump’s tariffs are a double-edged sword. The 25% levy on steel and aluminum, alongside broader import taxes, aims to boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods. In a ceremony at the White House, he framed it as a stand against countries that “treat the United States unfairly.” Economists warn, however, that this could disrupt global supply chains, raise consumer prices, and provoke retaliation. I admire the intent to prioritize American workers, but history—like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of the 1930s—suggests trade wars can backfire. I’d prefer a strategy that balances protectionism with cooperation, rather than risking economic isolation.

Energy policy is another flashpoint. Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” and his push for oil and gas drilling—coupled with abandoning wind and solar initiatives—reflect his long-standing mantra of “drill, baby, drill.” He’s argued this will lower energy costs and secure our future. As someone who values practical solutions, I can’t dismiss the appeal of energy independence. But I’m troubled by the dismissal of climate science. Withdrawing from the Paris Accord again feels like turning our back on a global challenge we can’t ignore. I’d rather see a plan that harnesses both fossil fuels and renewables, rather than betting everything on one.

Then there’s government reform. Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” led by figures like Elon Musk, promises to slash regulations and cut federal spending. His executive orders have targeted agencies like USAID, paused federal grants, and reclassified civil servants to make them easier to fire. He calls it draining the swamp; others call it dismantling oversight. I’m all for efficiency—government bloat is real—but this feels like a sledgehammer where a scalpel might do. Firing inspectors general and independent watchdogs risks weakening accountability, not strengthening it. I’d support reform that trims fat without gutting the system.

Perhaps most divisive are the pardons. Trump’s decision to pardon January 6 rioters has reignited old wounds. He frames it as justice for patriots; critics see it as rewarding lawlessness. I struggle with this. The rule of law matters deeply to me, and those who stormed the Capitol broke it. Yet, I understand the frustration of those who felt unheard. Pardons should heal, not divide, and I fear these widen the rift.

So, what’s my opinion of Donald Trump? It’s complicated. I respect his decisiveness. In a world of gridlock, he acts—sometimes with a clarity others lack. His supporters aren’t wrong to feel he fights for them; his energy and focus are undeniable. But I can’t shake my unease. His approach often sacrifices nuance for speed, consensus for control. The authoritarian streak—seen in his attacks on the press, his use of the Justice Department, and his admiration for strongmen—worries me. Democracy thrives on checks and balances, not unchecked power.

I also see a missed opportunity. Trump’s knack for rallying people could unite us around common goals—jobs, security, pride in our nation. Instead, his actions too often deepen our divides. Take his tariff announcement on April 2, dubbed “Liberation Day in America,” paired with a secondary tariff on Venezuela. It’s bold, but it’s also a gamble that could alienate allies and embolden adversaries.

In the end, I’m neither a cheerleader nor a detractor. I want Trump to succeed where it benefits us all—on the economy, on safety—but I want him to govern with more restraint, more inclusivity. His recent actions show a man doubling down on his vision, for better or worse. As citizens, we must watch closely, engage critically, and hold him accountable. Because whether you love him or loathe him, Donald Trump’s choices shape our future. Let’s ensure that future reflects the best of who we are.

Thank you.
