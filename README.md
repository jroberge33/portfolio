## About Me
#### My name is Jack Roberge; I am a third year studying Math and Data Science at Northeastern University. See a few samples of my work so far below! 

## Climate Data and Flight Delay Prediction Model 

#### **Question**: Can we use weather metrics from the NOAA to predict flight delays at Logan Airport in Boston, MA?  

#### **Method**: 
- Perform multivariate linear regression with continuous quantitative delay data
- Perform multiple iterations of a decision tree model using categorical delay data
- Perform KNN classification to predict high/low monthly flight delay volumes

#### **Analysis**:
