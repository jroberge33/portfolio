# Personal Portfolio 
## About Me
#### My name is `Jack Roberge`; I am a third year studying `Mathematics and Data Science` at `Northeastern University`. See a few samples of my work so far below! 

## Climate Data and Flight Delay Prediction Model 

Folder: https://github.com/jroberge33/portfolio/tree/main/weather_metrics_flight_delay_analysis

#### **Question**: Can we use weather metrics from the NOAA to predict flight delays at Logan Airport in Boston, MA?  

#### **Method**: 
- Perform `multivariate linear regression` with continuous quantitative delay data to see whether or not monthly average flight metrics can predict number of flight delays
- Perform multiple iterations of a `decision tree` model using categorical delay data, to determine if weather metrics can predict higher/lower volumes of delays
- Perform `knn classification` to predict high/low monthly flight delay volumes to determine if weather metrics can produce more granular predictions of flight delays

## KNN Prediction Model for Bank Failures

Folder: https://github.com/jroberge33/portfolio/tree/main/bank_failure_analysis

#### **Question**: Can a KNN classification model be used to predict whether or not a bank will fail based on the bank's financial data and metrics?

## Delta Sigma Pi Sigma Omega Application Interview Scheduling Code

Folder: https://github.com/jroberge33/portfolio/tree/main/interview_scheduler

#### **Question**: Can a program be used to schedule interviews for the fraternity's rush process, taking into account diversity in the interviewers; schedules of both interviewers and interviewees; and conflicts of interest between interviewers and interviewees?

## Catan Game Theory and Outcomes Analysis 

Folder: https://github.com/jroberge33/portfolio/tree/main/catan_analysis

#### **Question**: Can we gain insights into the outcomes and dynamics of the game of Catan from data on game starting positions and outcomes?

#### **Method**: 
- Analyze and visualize key game metrics, including roll probabilities, frequency of starting placement, and resource gains + losses
- Utilize multiple ML models to determine whether victory can be predicted based on starting resource and number placements, including `knn Classification` and `logistic regression`
- Employ `smote oversampling` to address a low count of wins in data as well as `principal component analysis` to address the high number of variables

#### **Analysis**: 

## Educational Outcomes and Attainment by Demographic Analysis through the COVID-19 Pandemic

Folder: https://github.com/jroberge33/portfolio/tree/main/pandemic_educational_outcomes_analysis

#### **Question**: Can we produce analytics and visualizations regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational metrics, through the lens of racial groups and states? 

#### **Method**: 
- Visualize and analyze school enrollment, educational attainment, and test scores to determine how the pandemic impacted educational outcomes
- Segment data by race, age group, and attainment level to determine whether the pandemic had outsized impacts on certain groups

#### **Analysis**: 

## Markov Chain Tennis Simulation
